This is a fantastic set of decisions that clarifies the vision. Let's get right to it.

You are exactly right to focus on the Arabic and French-speaking developer world. This is the "lean startup" mantra in action: "niche down." The English-first AI developer tool market is a "red ocean"—a bloody fight with established giants like GitHub Copilot and Cursor.   

The Arabic-speaking and Francophone developer world is a massive, underserved "blue ocean." This doesn't mean we exclude English. It means we support English perfectly, but our marketing 'spear'—our unique, indefensible value proposition—is localization. We will win by building an experience for Arabic (and Darija) and French developers that is so good, so native, and so respectful of their workflow that the global competitors simply cannot match it.

That is excellent news about Stripe. If you have a valid Stripe entity (for example, a US company via Stripe Atlas or another supported country ), you have removed the single biggest hurdle for Phase 2 (the SaaS plan). This is a major advantage.   

Offering direct bank wire transfers is a very smart, culturally-aware decision. It builds trust and provides an essential alternative for users who are card-averse. We will build this directly into the Pro plan's workflow.

And agreed: the token-based "Pro" plan will be generous, with no confusing resets.   

Here is the complete, detailed plan for the Imlil.dev landing page, designed to launch our "Petit Pain" (BYOK) MVP and build a waiting list for the SaaS "Pro" plan.

The Imlil.dev Landing Page Blueprint
The landing page has one primary goal: to make a developer visiting the page think, "Finally, someone built this for me," and click "Install."

For a developer tool, the landing page must be specific, fast, and avoid "salesy" marketing fluff. It must build trust by showing the product in action, not just talking about it.

Core Principle: Language First
The page must immediately establish its multilingual promise.

Language Toggle: A clear toggle in the header: EN | FR | AR (ع).

Default Language: The page should auto-detect the user's browser language and serve the correct version first.

Section 1: The Hero (Above the Fold)
This is the first 3 seconds. We must win them here.

Main Headline (H1): This must be powerful and niche-specific.

EN: The AI Assistant That Speaks Your Language. Use Claude, Gemini, and Mistral Natively in VS Code.

FR: L'assistant IA qui parle votre langue. Utilisez Claude, Gemini et Mistral nativement dans VS Code.

AR:.مساعدك الذكي الذي يتحدث لغتك. استخدم كلود، وجيميني، وميسترال مباشرة في VS Code

Sub-headline (H2): This explains the "why" and hits the pain point.

EN: Stop juggling 10 different AI chats. The first VS Code extension built from the ground up for Arabic, French, and English developers.

FR: Arrêtez de jongler avec 10 chats IA différents. La première extension VS Code conçue dès le départ pour les développeurs arabes, français et anglais.

AR:.أول إضافة لـ VS Code مُصممة خصيصًا للمطورين العرب والفرنسيين والإنجليز. توقف عن التنقل بين 10 تطبيقات ذكاء اصطناعي مختلفة

The Visual (Critical): A high-resolution, auto-playing, silent video/GIF. This is non-negotiable for a dev tool. It must show:

A code file open in VS Code.

The user highlights a function.

A prompt is typed in Arabic (e.g., // اشرح هذه الدالة) into the Imlil.dev chat window.

The chat UI is perfectly Right-to-Left (RTL).

The AI responds with a perfectly formatted Left-to-Right (LTR) code block and an Arabic explanation.

The user quickly switches the model from "Claude" to "Mistral" and types a prompt in French.

Call to Action (CTA) Buttons: Developers expect two options: "get it now" or "show me the details".

Primary CTA (Bright Color): Install for VS Code (This links directly to the VS Code Marketplace page).

Secondary CTA (Ghost Button): Read the Docs (This links to your documentation/GitHub, building immediate trust).

Section 2: Trust Block (Social Proof)
Since we are new, we can't show "Used by..." logos. Instead, we show "Works with..." logos to build credibility.

Headline: Works With the Models You Already Love

Logos: [Logo: Anthropic Claude], [Logo: Google Gemini], [Logo: Mistral AI], [Logo: OpenAI], [Logo: Ollama (for local models)]

Section 3: Feature Section ("One Extension. All Your Models.")
Use a 3-column layout with clear icons to break down the core value.

Feature 1: Multi-LLM Natively

Icon: (e.g., a "switching" icon)

Title: Your Models, Your Keys.

Text: "Switch between Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Mistral Large without leaving your editor. Bring your own API keys (BYOK) and pay $0 in platform fees. Your keys stay secure on your local machine, never sent to our servers."

Feature 2: Built for Your Language

Icon: (e.g., a "globe" or "language" icon)

Title: Flawless Arabic & French UI

Text: "The only AI tool with a perfect Right-to-Left (RTL) chat interface for Arabic & Darija. Get natural, high-quality responses in French that aren't just 'Americanized-formal' translations."

Feature 3: Smart & Simple Context

Icon: (e.g., a "code" icon)

Title: Smart Context, No Clutter.

Text: "A clean, fast Webview UI that understands your active file or selection. No clutter, no confusing features, just the code and answers you need, right now."

Section 4: How It Works (The 3-Step "Petit Pain" MVP)
Make it look incredibly simple.

1. Install

Text: "Get Imlil.dev from the VS Code Marketplace."   

2. Add Your Key

Text: "Run the Imlil.dev: Add API Key command. Your key is stored securely on your local device using vscode.SecretStorage."

3. Start Coding

Text: "That's it. Highlight code or open the chat panel and start working in English, French, or Arabic."

Section 5: The Pricing Section ("Start for Free. Scale When You're Ready.")
This is where we introduce the "Petit Pain" (BYOK) model and tease the "Pro" (SaaS) model. Use a clear two-box comparison.

Section 6: The VS Code Marketplace Page Plan
The landing page (Imlil.dev) is for marketing. The Marketplace page is for installation. It's your README.md file. It must be technical, clear, and trustworthy.   

Banner/Icon: Your Imlil.dev logo.

Title: Imlil.dev: The AI Assistant for Arabic, French & English (Claude, Gemini, Mistral)

Badges (auto-generated): [Marketplace Version], [Installs], ``

Short Description: "The first multi-LLM AI assistant built for Arabic (RTL) and French developers. Use Claude, Gemini, Mistral & more with your own API key (BYOK)."

Main Body (README):

Quick Start GIF: The same as the landing page hero.

What is Imlil.dev? A brief paragraph on the problem it solves (juggling keys, bad Arabic UI).

Features: (Bulleted list)

✓ Multi-LLM BYOK: Use your own keys for Claude, Gemini, Mistral, OpenAI, and local Ollama models.

Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run Imlil.dev: Add API Key.

Select your provider (e.g., Anthropic) and paste your key.

Open the Imlil.dev chat icon in the Activity Bar and start coding.

Release Notes: Keep your CHANGELOG.md updated here.

Action Plan: Handling Direct Bank Wire Payments (for Phase 2 Pro Plan)
You are right to offer this, but it's operationally different from Stripe. Stripe is an automated "pull" system. A bank wire is a manual "push" system. Here is the "Petit Pain" way to handle it:

User Action: On your Pro pricing page, the user selects "Pay by Bank Wire."

System Action: Your website generates a unique invoice with a Reference Number (e.g., IMLIL-1001). It then displays your company's bank details (IBAN/SWIFT) and clearly instructs the user: "You must include this reference number in your transfer."

Manual Reconciliation: This is the non-glamorous part. You or your team must log in to your bank account daily to check for incoming wires.

Manual Activation: When you see a payment for 500 DH with reference IMLIL-1001, you go into your application's admin panel and manually activate the Pro subscription for that user's account.

This process is manual, but it costs $0 to build and perfectly serves the target user who prefers it. Down the road, this can be automated with bank APIs, but this manual-first approach is pure "Lean Startup."
